**/ Thank you :) -Rob
	Sidenote - trying to make it to where when you click the hamburger (on the left with sm screen), a grey column shoots out on the left with "About, Team, For doctors, For patients"

	Ideas on how?

	Also gonna make the features and description hover over the photo

	Recommendations welcome..

hamburger on the right side when sizing? 
hamburger bun too big? 
some sort of color on nav bar to differentiate between the page and that (when you scroll you can't always see the nav text)
For the dropdown menu, search "css dropdown" on google and go to the w3 schools link! Should be what you're looking for.
